Introduction:

The run_analysis.R carries out the five task requested in this project

1. First, all the similar data is merged using the rbind() function. 
2. Now, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset.
After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
3. Descriptive activity names are used to name the activities in the data set and appropriately labels for 
the data set with descriptive activity names using activity_labels.txt
4. Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type 

Variables:

1. train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y, train_subject, test_subject are used as variable names to store
the test and training sets we will merge.

2. x, y and z are variable names of the binded sets of train_x and test_x, train_y and test_y and 
train_subject and test_subject respectively.

3. The variable "features" contains the correct names for x
4. Similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.
5. "tidy_Data" merges x, y and z as one dataset.
6. Lastly, we creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity 
and each subject and store the in a table called "tidy_mean_Data"
